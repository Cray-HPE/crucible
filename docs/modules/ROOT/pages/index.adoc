= Crucible

`crucible` is a command line tool for managing bare-metal, installing a live image to disk, and configuring a booted operating system.

The tool is currently written in Python, and exists only as a proof-of-concept.

== Proof of Concept

The proof of concept tool is very limited in terms of what OS configuration it offers to the user.
