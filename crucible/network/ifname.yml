# Highspeed network cards are very specific, these must match an exact Vendor and Device ID.
# Management network cards are less specific, anything that is not a highspeed network card but is of a certain vendor
# is considered a mangement network card; in other words management network cards only care about vendor IDs.
#
# These IDs can be resolved by running `lspci -nn | grep -i ethernet`
